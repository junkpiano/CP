## Installation

- Install VSCode
- Open in container from the bottom left icon, assuming you installed `dev containers` extension.
    - Install `dev containers` extension if you haven't installed it

Once you open this folder in container, VScode will start building a container.

## TODO

- Accomodate cpp files or my own cpp template, although the default one is pretty good.
- Fix typo
- Translate Japanese into English
