## Installation

1. Install VSCode.
2. If you haven't already, install the "dev containers" extension.
3. Open the folder in container by selecting the "Open in container" option from the bottom-left icon.

Once you open this folder in a container, VSCode will start building a container.

## TODO

Here are some things we are working on:

- Accommodating custom CPP files or using our own CPP templates. However, the default one provided is quite efficient.
- Fixing any typos.
- Translating Japanese documentation into English.
